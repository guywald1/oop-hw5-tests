This repository contains some tests for OOP HW5.

I'm using [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/tree/Catch1.x) as the unit-testing library.

# Instructions

Make sure to use a *nix shell, as I'm using `make`.

*   Run `make setup` to create the `/src` folder.
*   Copy your solution into `/src`: part 1 into `/src/part1` and part 2 into `/src/part2`.
*   Run `make`.
