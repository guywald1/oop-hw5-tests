This repository contains some basic tests for OOP HW5.
Currently I've only included tests for part 2, will hopefully update with tests for part 1.

I'm using [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) the unit-testing library.
It takes a while to compile (~10 seconds) so don't worry if it takes a few seconds.

# Instructions

Make sure to use a *nix shell, or any one that supports `make`.

*   Run `make setup` to create the `/src` folder.
*   Copy `Stream.h` and its dependencies into `/src`.
*   Run `make`.
